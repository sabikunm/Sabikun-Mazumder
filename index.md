# Sunscreen Reminder Hat
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was to sew the Adafruit Flora Board, the piezo buzzer and the UV Sensor all to my hat, and then connect it to a battery source so it can work continiously. After double threading, I started to sew the flora onto my hat using holes that were not used. Then I sewed the UV Sensor using the same method. Finally, since the buzzer had no holes I could sew around,I sewed around the wires instead which made everything tight fitted on the hat. Lastly, I used alligator clips to connect the board and my battery pack together. Pointing the hat to the sun, it would play or not play any tunes depending on the amount of sunlight shone.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was soldering all my components together. Using my soldering iron and metal filament, I soldered the UV Sensor and Adafruit Flora Board using jumper wires so they can connect, and also soldered the piezo buzzer to the board as well. I had to make sure all the wires were in the correct areas or I would have to resolder everything. Once I finished, I uploaded the code to my Adafruit Flora and the buzzer played the Sumer Mario Brothers theme song successfully.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was to get familar with the Adafruit Flora, the UV sensor and download the appropiate software. I started out by reading brief descriptions about the flora board and its uses; the flora can be worn on clothing through sewing and is great for simplicity . Next, I downloaded Arduino, but because my flora was not compatible with my current board (Arduino Uno), I had to download another board. This process was difficult and time consuming since it took me many tries to upload the code to my flora. However, I was able to upload the code by downloading the Adafruit AVR Board which helped me complete my first milestone.
