# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to get familar with the Adafruit Flora, download the appropiate software and finally make the buzzer ring. I started out by reading breif descriptions about the flora and its uses; the flora can be worn on clothing through sewing and is great for simplicity . Next, I downloaded Arduino, but because my flora was not compatible with my current board (Arduino Uno), I had to download another board. This process was difficult and time consuming since it took me many tries to upload the code to my flora. However, I was able to upload the code by downloading the Adafruit AVR Board which led me into my last step which was to make the buzzer ring.
